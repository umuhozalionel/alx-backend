# Caching System

This project explores different caching algorithms such as FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU. It implements these algorithms in Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- pycodestyle 2.5

## Structure
- `base_caching.py`: Base class for caching systems.
- `0-basic_cache.py`: Basic caching system implementation.
- More caching implementations to come...

## Usage
Each caching class can be tested with the provided main scripts (e.g., `0-main.py` for BasicCache).
